# ESP_Sensors_Integration
By integrating all sensors it is working fine.

# Testing
But if testing without sensors is required then i won't work until DHT11 the connecting in the way demonstrated in Fritzing schematic. so dht11 must have to be connected and other sensors can be skipped to get the raw data.
